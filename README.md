## Executive Summary

**Sankofa** is a revolutionary platform that addresses two critical challenges in Ghana simultaneously: plastic pollution and healthcare access. By creating a circular economy where plastic waste is converted into health benefits, we're building a sustainable future while improving community health outcomes.

### Quick Facts

-  **Mission:** Transform plastic pollution into predictive health intelligence and healthcare access
-  **Location:** Ghana (expanding to West Africa)
-  **Target:** 10,000 collectors, 100 collection hubs in first year
-  **Innovation:** AI-powered health risk mapping linked to plastic pollution data
-  **Impact:** Bridge the healthcare access gap for underserved communities

### The Innovation

Sankofa creates a dual-value system:
1. **Immediate Value:** Collectors earn 70% cash + 30% health tokens for plastic collection
2. **Long-term Value:** Aggregated data powers AI health insights to predict and prevent disease outbreaks

---

## The Problem

### 1. Plastic Pollution Crisis in Ghana

**Statistics:**
- Ghana generates **1 million tons** of plastic waste annually
- Only **5%** is recycled
- **86%** ends up in landfills or the environment
- Plastic pollution costs Ghana's economy **$290 million/year**
- Contributes to flooding, disease spread, and environmental degradation

**Health Connection:**
- Plastic-clogged drains → Malaria breeding grounds
- Contaminated water sources → Cholera, typhoid outbreaks
- Burning plastic → Respiratory diseases
- Microplastics → Long-term health impacts

### 2. Healthcare Access Gap

**Challenges:**
- **40% of Ghanaians** lack access to quality healthcare
- Rural areas severely underserved
- NHIS (National Health Insurance Scheme) enrollment barriers
- Out-of-pocket healthcare costs push families into poverty
- Lack of preventive health data

### 3. Limited Predictive Health Intelligence

**Current State:**
- Reactive healthcare system (treat after outbreak)
- Poor data collection on environmental health factors
- No correlation between pollution and disease prevalence
- Missed opportunities for early intervention

**The Gap:** No system connects environmental data (plastic pollution) with health outcomes to enable predictive analytics and prevention.

## The Solution

### Sankofa's Three-Pillar Approach

#### 1. **Incentivized Plastic Collection**
Turn plastic waste into income and health benefits:
- Collectors bring plastic to certified hubs
- Earn **70% cash** (immediate income)
- Earn **30% health tokens** (healthcare access)
- Gamification with points, levels, and rewards

#### 2. **Healthcare Bridge**
Make healthcare accessible and affordable:
- Health tokens → NHIS enrollment
- Health tokens → Medication subsidies
- Health tokens → Preventive care services
- Partnership with healthcare providers

#### 3. **Predictive Health Intelligence (AI-Powered)**
Transform data into actionable health insights:
- Map plastic pollution hotspots
- Correlate with disease outbreak data
- AI predicts high-risk areas for specific diseases
- Enable preventive interventions
- Inform public health policy

### The Sankofa Difference

**"Sankofa"** is an Akan word meaning *"go back and fetch it"* - retrieving wisdom from the past to build the future. Our platform embodies this by:
- Reclaiming waste (plastic) to create value
- Using traditional community structures (collection hubs)
- Leveraging modern technology (AI, blockchain for tokens)
- Building sustainable futures from discarded materials

## How It Works

### The Collection Cycle

```
1. Collector gathers plastic waste
   ↓
2. Brings to nearest Sankofa Hub
   ↓
3. Hub Manager weighs and verifies
   ↓
4. System calculates rewards:
   - Weight × Rate = Total Points
   - 70% → Cash (mobile money)
   - 30% → Health Tokens
   ↓
5. Plastic sent for recycling
   ↓
6. Data feeds AI health analytics
   ↓
7. Insights shared with health authorities
```

### The Data Flow

```
Collection Data:
- Location (GPS)
- Plastic type
- Quantity
- Date/Time
   ↓
Aggregation & Analysis:
- Pollution hotspot mapping
- Temporal patterns
- Type distribution
   ↓
AI Correlation Engine:
- Match with disease data
- Identify risk patterns
- Predict outbreak zones
   ↓
Actionable Insights:
- Alert health authorities
- Targeted interventions
- Resource allocation
- Community education
```
